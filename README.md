## Instructions

This is my version of the classic card-matching memory game, Concentration!. To play, load the game on to your browser. 
I have utilized the starter code provided by Udacity (the HTML and CSS) to create the "look" of the game.

To start playing, click on the "Start" button. A deck of 16 cards will be displayed face-down. To win the game, you must
match all 8 pairs. Click on a card to reveal the icon it contains, then chose a second. If the icons match, the cards will
remain face up. If they don't match, then both selected cards will be hidden again. Each of these above mentioned actions
will be considered a "move". Your goal is to match up all 8 pairs, in the minimum amount of time and by making the least number
of moves. 

You can reset the game during gameplay, if you want to re-start the game. Just click on the "Reset" button. 

At the end of the game, when you win, a modal dialogue will give you your stats and also offer you the chance to play again

ENJOY!
